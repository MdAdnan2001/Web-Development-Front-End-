<h2>Salman Khan Career </h2>
<p>Khan made his acting debut with the 1988 film Biwi Ho To Aisi, which saw him play a supporting role. He went on to play the leading role in Sooraj R. Barjatya's romantic family drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), which become one of the highest-grossing Indian films at the time.[41][42] It earned him his first nomination for the Best Actor at Filmfare along with a nomination for Best Male Debut at the same ceremony; the latter was awarded to Barjatya.[43] Maine Pyar Kiya was dubbed in English as When Love Calls, in Spanish as Te Amo, and in Telugu as Prema Paavuraalu.[44]</p>
<p>In 1994, Khan appeared in Rajkumar Santoshi's Andaz Apna Apna, co-starring Aamir Khan.

During the 1995 awards season, the film won 3 Filmfare Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress. It also won the National Award for being the most popular film of the year.[47] Earning more than ₹2 billion[48][49][50] ($63.8 million) worldwide, the film became the biggest Bollywood hit of the year and the highest-grossing Indian film up until then.[51] It is one of the films on Box Office India's list of "Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema".[52] In 2006, it was still the fourth-highest grossing Bollywood film ever, according to Box Office India.[53] In 1995 he starred in Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun alongside Shah Rukh Khan. The two played brothers who are reincarnated after being killed by family enemies. His role as Karan earned him a nomination for the 1995 Filmfare Best Actor Award.[54]</p>
<p>In 1996, Khan performed in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's directional debut Khamoshi: The Musical.[55] He also appeared in and Raj Kanwar's action hit Jeet.[56] He had two releases in 1997: Judwaa and Auzaar.

<p>Khan worked in five different films in 1998, his first release being the romantic comedy film Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya opposite Kajol, one of the biggest commercial successes of that year.[58] This was followed by the moderately successful drama Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai [59] where Khan played a young man who has to take a child who claims to be his son, under his custody. Khan's performance in the film earned favourable critical review.[60] He also had an extended cameo in Karan Johar's directorial debut, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, for which he earned a second Filmfare Award under the Best Supporting Actor category.[61]</p>
<p>Khan's next releases Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dabangg 2 (2012), Kick (2014), Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) and Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (2015) were among the most successful Indian films, making him the first actor with several consecutive films earning over ₹1 billion at the box-office.[20][21] Among these, Bajrangi Bhaijaan earned over ₹900 crore worldwide and gained Khan a National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor, making him the most nominated actor in the category without ever winning.[22] He collaborated with director Ali Abbas Zafar to play titular lead in the top-grossing productions Sultan (2016), Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) and Bharat (2019).[23][24] He has since received criticism for producing and starring in hugely panned action films like Race 3 (2018), Dabangg 3 (2019) and Radhe (2021)</p>
